# Introduction

This site contains the analyses related to _Genomic context of variably-methylated repetitive elements in mouse_, a manuscript by Jessica Elmer, Amir Hay, and Noah Kessler, under the supervision of Prof. Anne Ferguson-Smith.

This project is an update, an improvement, and an expansion on [Kazachenka & Bertozzi _et al_. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.09.043).

# Analyses

## IAP Annotations

This analysis helped fix issues with the RepeatMasker annotations of IAPs.
See [01.IAP_Annotations.html](01.IAP_Annotations.html).

## Updated screen for VM-IAPs

An update of the screen for VM-IAPs, similar to that performed in Kazachenka & Bertozzi _et al_., using the improved reference and with some improvements in implementation.
See [02.Screen_for_VM_IAP.html](02.Screen_for_VM_IAP.html).

## Validations and tsVM-IAPs

Analyses to be added.

## Expansion of screen to other repeat classes

Analyses to be added.

## CTCF binding

Analyses to be added.
